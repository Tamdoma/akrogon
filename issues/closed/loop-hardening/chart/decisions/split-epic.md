# How are the ten reports grouped?

## Question
One epic with six issues, or six standalone issues?

### Carries
shapes.md: a GitHub report has exactly one completion owner; #10 and #14 span four destinations.

## Findings
(both) #10 and #14 need a container owner. (B) an epic delays closure of narrow sources until the epic moves under current code; see source-owner-closure.

## Resolution
Operator 2026-09-11: `1a`. Epic `loop-hardening` owns #10 and #14. Issues `record-sync` (#7), `dispatch-progress` (#6, #9, #11), `recoverable-completion` (#5, #13), `lifecycle-records` (#8), `command-outcomes` (none), `review-protocol` (#12). Foreclosed: standalone issues with #10/#14 attached to whichever finishes last.
